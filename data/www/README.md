- JavaScript uses modern ES6+ features
- Theme preferences are stored in localStorage
- API calls use fetch() for modern async communication
- Responsive design uses CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support

## File Upload Instructions

To upload the web interface files to your LoRaTNCX device:

1. Build your project first: `pio run`
2. Upload the filesystem: `pio run --target uploadfs`
3. Upload the firmware: `pio run --target upload`

The web interface will be available immediately after the device boots and connects to WiFi or starts its access point.
