# LED Reference Correction Summary

## Issue Identified
The project contained references to "CON and STA LEDs" which was confusing since the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4 board only has a single built-in LED on GPIO 35.

## Changes Made

### Code Changes
1. **TNCCommandParser.cpp**: Updated message in `handleKissImmediate()` from "CON and STA LEDs will flash three times" to "Status LED will flash three times"

2. **TNCManager.cpp**: 
   - Updated message in `enterKissMode()` from "CON and STA LEDs will flash three times" to "Status LED will flash three times"
   - Updated comment in `flashKissLEDs()` to clarify it uses the single status LED as a substitute for the original TNC-2's separate CON/STA LEDs
   - Updated success message from "KISS mode activated (LEDs flashed 3 times)" to "KISS mode activated (status LED flashed 3 times)"

### Documentation Updates
3. **README.md**: Updated KISS mode example to show "Status LED will flash three times" instead of "CON and STA LEDs will flash three times"

4. **KISS_BEHAVIOR_SPECIFICATION.md**: Updated all references throughout the document to reflect single status LED usage

## Hardware Configuration
The LED configuration in `HardwareConfig.h` was already correct:
```cpp
#define STATUS_LED_PIN     LED_BUILTIN  // Built-in LED (Pin 35)
#define LED_ON             HIGH
#define LED_OFF            LOW
```

## Implementation Details
- The actual LED flashing implementation was already correct, using `STATUS_LED_PIN`
- Method name `flashKissLEDs()` was kept for consistency with KISS protocol terminology
- The LED flashing behavior remains identical - 3 flashes of 200ms on/off
- All functionality is preserved, only confusing text references were corrected

## Result
- ✅ All references now accurately reflect the single status LED on GPIO 35
- ✅ No confusion about non-existent separate CON/STA LEDs  
- ✅ Maintains TAPR TNC-2 compatibility while being hardware-accurate
- ✅ Build successful with no errors
- ✅ Functionality unchanged, only messaging clarified

The project now accurately describes the LED behavior specific to the Heltec V4 hardware while maintaining the authentic TAPR TNC-2 KISS protocol behavior.
