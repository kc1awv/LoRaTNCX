# TNC Host Connection Enhancement Summary

## Feature Added: BANNER Command

### Problem Addressed
When users connect to the LoRaTNCX TNC via serial terminal, they may not see the welcome banner or know what commands are available, especially if they connect after the initial boot sequence.

### Solution Implemented
Added a **BANNER** command that users can send at any time to display the welcome banner and basic information about the TNC.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Command Added
```
BANNER           - Show welcome banner
```

### 2. Command Processing
Added to `TNCCommandParser.cpp`:
```cpp
} else if (command == "BANNER") {
    handleBanner();
```

### 3. Handler Implementation
```cpp
void TNCCommandParser::handleBanner() {
    printBanner();
}
```

### 4. Banner Content
The BANNER command displays:
```
============================================
   LoRaTNCX v2.0 - LoRa TNC with KISS
   Compatible with TAPR TNC-2 commands
   Hardware: Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4
============================================

Type 'HELP' for command list
Current callsign: [current callsign]
```

### 5. Enhanced Boot Banner
Also improved the boot sequence banner in `main.cpp`:
```cpp
Serial.println();
Serial.println("=== LoRaTNCX v2.0 - TAPR TNC-2 Compatible ===");
Serial.println("Hardware: Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4 (ESP32-S3)");  
Serial.println("LoRa Chip: SX1262, RadioLib: v7.4.0");
Serial.println("Type HELP for command list");
Serial.println();
Serial.print("cmd:");
```

## User Benefits

### 1. **Immediate Welcome Information**
Users can type `BANNER` after connecting to get:
- TNC identification and version
- Hardware information  
- Current configuration
- Next steps (HELP command)

### 2. **Better User Experience**
- No need to reset the device to see welcome message
- Clear indication that the TNC is responsive
- Consistent branding and information display

### 3. **Troubleshooting Aid**
- Helps verify TNC is responding to commands
- Shows current callsign and basic status
- Provides guidance on next steps

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```
cmd:BANNER
============================================
   LoRaTNCX v2.0 - LoRa TNC with KISS
   Compatible with TAPR TNC-2 commands  
   Hardware: Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4
============================================

Type 'HELP' for command list
Current callsign: NOCALL

cmd:
```

### Combined with Other Commands
```
cmd:BANNER
[banner displays]

cmd:MYCALL KI7ABC
MYCALL set to KI7ABC

cmd:BANNER  
[banner displays with updated callsign: KI7ABC]
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`src/TNCCommandParser.cpp`**: Added command processing and handler
2. **`include/TNCCommandParser.h`**: Added handleBanner() declaration  
3. **`src/main.cpp`**: Enhanced boot banner display

### Memory Impact
- Minimal flash increase (~200 bytes)
- No RAM impact (uses existing printBanner() function)
- No performance impact

### Compatibility
- Fully compatible with existing TNC operations
- Does not interfere with KISS mode
- Standard TAPR TNC-2 command format

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. **Automatic DTR/RTS Detection** ❌
- Initially attempted to detect terminal connections automatically
- ESP32-S3 USB-Serial/JTAG mode doesn't support standard DTR methods
- Would have been hardware-dependent and unreliable

### 2. **Connection Activity Monitoring** ❌  
- Considered monitoring serial activity to detect new connections
- Complex to implement reliably
- Could interfere with normal TNC operations

### 3. **Manual BANNER Command** ✅ **CHOSEN**
- Simple and reliable
- User-controlled when to display information
- Compatible with all terminal programs
- No hardware dependencies

## Result

The BANNER command provides a simple, reliable way for users to:
- ✅ Get immediate TNC identification when connecting
- ✅ See current configuration status  
- ✅ Verify TNC responsiveness
- ✅ Get guidance on available commands

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience when connecting to the LoRaTNCX TNC, making it more user-friendly and professional.
