# Things To Work On

- Implement web interface for device configuration and monitoring (we have 16MB of flash and 2MB of PSRAM to utilize, let's make the most of it).
- Add support for additional modulation schemes that the SX126x supports (e.g., FSK).
- Implement IGate functionality to forward APRS packets to the internet.
- Better OLED graphics and status indicators, possibly using a graphics library.
- Better OLED power management to reduce consumption when idle.
- Implement OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates via WiFi. (I think it works now, but needs testing and documentation).
- Add support and/or documentation for additional LoRa frequency bands (e.g., 433MHz, 868MHz) to make the device more versatile.
- Implement advanced logging features, such as logging to an SD card or sending logs over WiFi.
- Eventually, consider adding Bluetooth LE support for configuration, monitoring, and applications via mobile apps.
- Implement adaptive data rate (ADR) for LoRa communication to optimize performance based on link conditions.
- Add support for additional sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity) and display their readings on the OLED, web interface, and over APRS.
- Implement a more user-friendly configuration interface, possibly with a web-based GUI (see above).
- Explore power-saving modes for the ESP32 to extend battery life in portable applications.
- Add support for mesh networking capabilities using LoRa. (oh god, the horror)
- Implement security features for LoRa communication, such as encryption and authentication.
- Implement a more robust error handling and recovery mechanism for LoRa communication.
- Add support for additional display types (e.g., TFT, e-ink) for more versatile user interfaces.
- Implement a more modular code structure to facilitate future development and maintenance.
- Improve documentation and add more examples for users and developers.
- Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
