# Code of Conduct

Yes, this is a code of conduct. It's here because humans are messy and the internet has feelings.
We're running an open-source project that loves curiosity, experimentation, and tinkering with radio waves.
That also means we expect basic human decency. Shocking, I know.

## Our Intent (The Short Version)
- Be respectful. Treat people like fellow humans, not walking bug reports.
- Be helpful. Provide useful information when you report issues or submit changes.
- Be chill. We’re here to learn, debug, and occasionally triumph.

If you can do those three things, you’re fine. If not, you’ll be asked to leave the conversation until you can.

## Scope
This code of conduct applies to all project spaces, including:
- GitHub Issues and Pull Requests
- Project discussions and comments
- The project's public documentation and web interface (yes, even the web UI has manners)
- Real-world events and any interaction where you publicly represent this project

## The Standards (Because Vague Nice-Sounding Rules Are Useless)
Do this:
- Assume good intent. People are trying. Offer corrective feedback, not theatrical condemnation.
- Provide constructive, actionable feedback. “This is broken” is less helpful than “This fails on X; logs show Y.”
- Cite evidence: steps to reproduce, hardware used, firmware build, and console output. We love reproducible bug reports.

Don’t do this:
- Harassment, threats, or slurs of any kind. No one wants that here.
- Personal attacks, doxxing, or targeting maintainers/contributors.
- Hate speech, violent or sexual harassment, or anything illegal. This isn’t the place.
- Spamming issues, creating duplicate reports on purpose, or intentionally poisoning conversations.

## Reporting Problems
If someone crosses the line or you're uncomfortable, tell us. Preferred approaches in order of speed and privacy:

1. Open a GitHub Issue titled `CODE-OF-CONDUCT: <brief summary>` and describe the incident. Include links and timestamps if possible.
2. Mention a maintainer by GitHub handle (e.g. `@kc1awv`) in that issue so it gets attention.

If the issue is sensitive and you don't want it public, say so in the issue title and we will handle it discreetly on a best-effort basis. We can't promise absolute confidentiality because GitHub issues are public, but we will take privacy seriously.

If you believe there's imminent danger or a legal issue, contact the appropriate local authorities. We can escalate to GitHub Support if needed.

## Enforcement
We’ll respond to reports in a reasonable time frame (usually a few days, faster if urgent). Possible actions include:
- Request for clarification or additional information
- Temporary or permanent blocking from the repo/discussion spaces
- Reverting posts or changes that break this code of conduct
- Referral to platform support or law enforcement in extreme cases

We aim for transparency. When action is taken, we’ll document what happened and why (unless privacy concerns prevent us from doing so).

## Be Reasonable
This is a small project run by humans who sometimes make mistakes and sometimes need naps.
We aren’t running a court of law. We’re asking for common decency and a bit of patience when conflicts arise.

If you want to be an extra-awesome contributor, do this:
- Include hardware revisions, firmware version, and exact commands when reporting problems.
- Run tests on real hardware when feasible. Virtual LoRa is not yet a thing.
- Help others — even a small hint about the right serial port or a failing log line can save hours.

## Attribution
Inspired by the Contributor Covenant and adapted to the temperament of this project: a little sarcastic, mostly helpful.

Thanks for keeping this space civilized. Now go break something (in code), then fix it, then tell us how you did it.
