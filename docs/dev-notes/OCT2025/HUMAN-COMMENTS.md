*Initial findings: Though Claude considers this implementation complete, there are a few outstanding issues. Additionally, Claude also thought (and incorrectly corrected) that the target device (Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4) has 8MB flash. This was reasoned because the board definition uses the V3 (V4 is "pin compatible") which by definition has only 8MB flash. Despite this, the code compiles and still uses a reasonable amount of space, giving promise to also adding in V3 support if I feel like it. Perhaps asking Claude to create a custom board definition until Platformio adds in the new board will help.*

The initial implementation thus far (27 OCT 25) is a pretty good start. The visual side of the interface looks well structured, albeit with some issues I noticed right off the bat:

- The data on the page is not correct for Radio Status and Battery, posssibly also for GNSS (I'm currently indoors and have no sky to point the thing at)
- The source index page uses Bootstrap CSS like I asked for, but the page's links to the CSS are from a CDN instead of served locally. This will be an issue with people accessing the device in AP mode and no Internet connection. Maybe my initial prompt was unclear on this.

### Positive Outlook:

It's still a good start. With some additional abuse of Claude explaining the shortcomings, I'm sure that the web interface will become more useful/stable.

### Disposition:

Continue work until the web interface is satisfactory. This is not PR ready yet.

Updates:

- Fixed a lot of the web interface issues, though not all 
  - Backup configuration doesn't produce a file? At least, nothing attempts a download
- Added in dark-mode support for the web interface
- Going to try creating a custom board definition based on the V3 to utilize the larger flash space without causing future issues or reversions
