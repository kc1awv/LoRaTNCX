# KISS Behavior Correction - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully corrected the LoRaTNCX KISS implementation to exactly match authentic TAPR TNC-2 behavior as specified in the original documentation. This ensures full compatibility with existing KISS applications that expect authentic TNC-2 behavior.

## Problem Identified
The initial KISS implementation was functionally correct but behaviorally different from authentic TAPR TNC-2 hardware:
- `KISS ON` immediately entered KISS mode (incorrect)
- No LED flashing behavior (missing feature)
- No distinction between KISS ON and immediate KISS entry

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes Made

#### 1. TNCCommandParser.h
- Added `bool kissOnFlag` member variable to track KISS enable state
- Added `getKissFlag()` method for external access to flag state
- Added `handleKissImmediate()` declaration for KISSM command

#### 2. TNCCommandParser.cpp  
- Modified `handleKiss()` to set flag without changing mode
- Updated `handleRestart()` to check flag and enter KISS mode if set
- Added `handleKissImmediate()` for immediate KISS entry (KISSM command)
- Updated command processing to handle KISSM command
- Updated help text to reflect correct behavior
- Implemented `getKissFlag()` accessor method

#### 3. TNCManager.h
- Added `flashKissLEDs()` method declaration
- Added `#include "HardwareConfig.h"` for LED pin definitions

#### 4. TNCManager.cpp
- Implemented `flashKissLEDs()` with 3-flash sequence
- Updated `enterKissMode()` to check KISS flag and flash LEDs when appropriate
- Enhanced KISS mode entry coordination

## Authentic TAPR TNC-2 Behavior Now Implemented

### KISS ON Command
```
cmd: KISS ON
TNC: KISS mode will be enabled on restart
[Remains in command mode, sets internal flag]
```

### RESTART Command (with KISS flag set)
```
cmd: RESTART  
TNC: Restarting TNC into KISS mode...
TNC: CON and STA LEDs will flash three times
[LEDs flash 3 times]
[Enters KISS mode silently]
```

### KISSM Command (immediate entry)
```
cmd: KISSM
TNC: Entering KISS mode immediately...
[Enters KISS mode without LED flashing]
```

### RESTART Command (without KISS flag)
```
cmd: RESTART
TNC: Restarting TNC into command mode...
cmd: [Remains in command mode]
```

## LED Flashing Implementation
- Uses CON and STA LED pins from HardwareConfig.h
- Flashes both LEDs simultaneously 3 times
- 200ms on, 200ms off timing per flash
- Only occurs for KISS ON + RESTART sequence
- Does NOT occur for KISSM immediate entry

## Technical Details

### Flag Management
- `kissOnFlag` tracks whether KISS ON has been issued
- Flag persists until KISS mode is actually entered
- Flag is checked during restart to determine mode
- Flag can be queried externally via `getKissFlag()`

### Mode Coordination  
- TNCCommandParser manages command parsing and flag state
- TNCManager handles actual mode switching and LED control
- Proper callback system coordinates between components
- Clean separation of concerns maintained

### Compatibility Impact
- Existing KISS applications will work without modification
- Behavior now matches what software expects from TNC-2 hardware
- Authentic command sequences produce expected results
- LED behavior provides visual feedback like real hardware

## Validation & Testing

### Build Status
- ✅ Compilation successful with no errors
- ✅ All dependencies resolved (RadioLib v7.4.0)
- ✅ Memory usage: RAM 5.8%, Flash 4.8%
- ✅ Ready for hardware testing

### Test Scenarios to Verify
1. **KISS ON without RESTART**: Should set flag but stay in command mode
2. **RESTART after KISS ON**: Should enter KISS mode with LED flashing  
3. **RESTART without KISS ON**: Should stay in command mode
4. **KISSM command**: Should enter KISS mode immediately without LEDs
5. **Command operation after KISS ON**: Should work normally until RESTART

## Documentation Updated
- ✅ README.md updated with corrected KISS behavior examples
- ✅ KISS_BEHAVIOR_SPECIFICATION.md created with detailed documentation
- ✅ Command descriptions updated to reflect authentic behavior
- ✅ Usage examples corrected to show proper sequences

## Files Modified

## Result
The LoRaTNCX now exhibits authentic TAPR TNC-2 KISS behavior, ensuring compatibility with existing packet radio software while maintaining all modern functionality. The implementation is complete, tested (compilation), and ready for hardware validation.

## Next Steps
1. **Hardware Testing**: Upload to actual Heltec V4 board and test KISS sequences
2. **Application Testing**: Test with APRS applications and packet programs
3. **LED Verification**: Confirm LED flashing works as specified
4. **Documentation**: Update any additional documentation as needed
